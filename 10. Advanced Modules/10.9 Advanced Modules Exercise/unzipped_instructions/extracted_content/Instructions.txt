Good work on unzipping the file!
You should now see 5 folders, each with a lot of random .txt files.
Within one of these text files is a telephone number formated ###-###-#### 
Use the Python os module and regular expressions to iterate through each file, open it, and search for a telephone number.
Good luck!
