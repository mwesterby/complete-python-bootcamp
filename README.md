# complete-python-bootcamp üêç

My notes and assessments from the 2021 [Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) course on Udemy. Thought I'd finally learn Python, and pretty amazed I've made it this far without it!

### Setup
This repo can  be viewed on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mwesterby/complete-python-bootcamp/) for better rendering of the Jupyter Notebooks than in GitHub. Alternatively, to look at the files locally and interact with the notebooks:

1. Download and install the [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Open the Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook.
3. Clone this repo and navigate to its directory in the Jupyter Notebook file browser. Then open the notebook of interest.
